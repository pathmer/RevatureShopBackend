# Revature Swag Shop: Back End

The Revature Swag shop is an employee accesible merchandise store that was built from scratch and uses a micro service architecture. As a revature employee, you can login to the shop and view your RevCoins (the shop currency) history. An employee can exchange these RevCoins for the various goods the shop offers.
